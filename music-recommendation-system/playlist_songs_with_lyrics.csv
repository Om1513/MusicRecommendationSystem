A month at least, you probably couldnt sleep I guess, tryin to think of everything that rhymes with...everything must come with some degree of pullin teeth You tellin Marlo you cant go to his fox hunt retreat Cause of this humongous heap of things that rhyme with wannabe Tellin Rowan youre not goin to battle in some fuckin club in Leeds On Dont Flop Hustlin It Free cause you got an upcoming book release And I congratulated him like, You wrote a book? What an amazing guy. When you hear he wrote a book your thoughts go to some of our greatest minds I said, Whats your book about? Space and time? Ancient tribes? The economic crisis as we sit back and watch inflation rise No, no, no, its a novel, something more on the creative vibe No, conspiracy theories Children of  The Matrix  vibe David Icke Please, tell me the subject youre takin with this publication, cause I cannot take the hype He looked me dead in the face, and right He said, I wrote a book about complicated rhymes. Complicated rhymes?! Yeah. Multisyllabics They absolutely have to be done when you rap to the punch of it like Plus the grammatical structure and pattern needs a straight function and fashion But Ill allow for slight discrepancies depending on the native tongue of the accent but that does come with an asterisks And...you know...you know...who needs to kiss a girl? Thats stuff just a distraction, I dont need direct sunlight or a shower. None of it Why would I go to a club and get plastered When I can stay at home, figure out the number of attractors And sift through my rejection emails to see if the publishers havent told me I need to- told me I need to be fuckin embarrassed? Im joking Hes kissed a girl before Have you kissed a girl before? Hes kissed a girl before In fact, Shuffle and his ex just finalized a fuckin divorce Bitch wrote the man a rhyme for Valentines and he told her her multis were forced The man even pointed a score Give her just under a four She laughed it off Oh my Adam its funny for sure. But he said she shouldve known better she did something he just couldnt ignore Especially now hes booked in the store so he doesnt love her no more Fuckin run for the door Fuckin guy Awkward as fuck, walkin like hes got a wooden spine Doesnt let you sing Happy Birthday to him because it doesnt rhyme Wore his weird fuckin trench coat a 100 times Got you lookin like you come disguised As a cunt that likes the under 5s Nonce! Wore it so many times he doesnt need to hang up his coat He hasnt washed it in years He takes it off and it stands on its own That coat is alive Its symbiosis It demands the controls when attached to a host I saw him put his hand inside said jacket, and it actually moaned Oooh yeah. Oooh ye- Either its been the same jacket for 10 years or you got ten on a rack on a special stack like  Dexters Lab Each of em have a tiny pocket which contains a microscopic list of all the sex youve had That coat screams, Why does she never text me back? So dirty every time he wears it his neck gets chapped and his flesh is cracked with a reddish rash I gave him a hook last week and my leg was scratched I had to get a ? Fuck that coat! Ive never known anything to smell as bad, it gets me mad When I see it, it makes me wanna Jet like a Pepsi ad for collecting cans That ones for the Netflix fans, you get me gang? Baow! Thats my first round in, safe star blessed Ive got two more rounds and plenty more space in my graveyard left! Round 1: Shuffle T Everybody’s been, telling me I won’t ever survive my next foe I was never alive, been sentenced to life, they sent me to fry at death row They’ve already supplied some fresh clothes, the burial site, the headstone I’m dead on arrival, end of the line, but ready to die, so let’s go! That’s why I’ve drafted a will… Now Id like  Sounds Like  to continue so I leave the registered rights to Pedro And I want Big J to finally get that sexy, designer trench coat And to Soul I leave my engraved piece of Jefferson Price’s bedpost And a really, really, really long collection of rhymes for  Death Note Because I’m battling Shotty Horroh – yeah? The genius I mean it In Manchester, this guy is Jesus I am in utter shock, Im giddy – in pieces Underprepared best man...I’m speechless They said, Shotty’s back to battling, it’s just like the olden days. Couldn’t believe it “God’s back, huh? Holy shoulder blades” Well fuck it I’m back, too What’s up Premier Battles? You already know the dizzle Been underground, now Shuffs back in town, lock up your daughters; Josef Fritzl But this battle was meant to be last April, honestly He called it off… I’m like, What? But mate, you promised me. I asked if it’s still happening, he’s like “Maybe. Possibly” I’ve been patiently waiting for this ancient prophesy Too pussy to actually face me properly He’s pissing himself worried that he’ll take a loss to me (colostomy) It’s taken you three prime ministers and a change of monarchy Do you understand how many lines I wrote that are now outdated due to your attitude? Do you understand how many Will Smith/Chris Rock punchlines I had to scrap for you?! And organizing an event and putting yourself as the headline is the worst mate It smacks of those kids who charged the other kids to come to their birthday We’re having this clash judged too, by performers he would have to know Because they rap for, YOUR platform – this sports arena that you own I can only imagine which way they all will see the battle go This is about as unbiased as Kim Jong Un in a North Korean Talent show I’ve also seen your battles though – I’ve got you figured out: Roids Simmer down, mate, you should be chilling out, poised Think about it all he has is a loud voice But your writing’s more of a shits how than  Mrs. Brown’s Boys You hit mid-thirties and went up about six dress sizes You are a limping, groaning, knuckle-dragging midlife crisis I don’t care who’s most popular, I care about who’s the nicest You have a bigger name than me? So does fucking Isis Now, I preferred you when you were off the roids and thin But now he’s addicted to working out and it’s poisoned him You on social media is an extremely annoying thing My whole Twitter feed is you and Cojay just agreeing you enjoy the gym I want the stick person that we’ve seen, this version baffles me Wants to wrestle now? Well, I doubt we’ll see a big surge in casualties Such a fake guy he’ll only fake fight, he’ll inverse to atrophy Want to wrestle so bad? Go wrestle with your split personality I’m praying and I am hoping that by the end of this his head is fixed I’m talking to him, since it’s clear a therapist never did Cause you on social media is nuts I mean, you’ve got this anger that brews There’s different versions of him, these doppelgängers you use Someone says something you don’t like? He’s gotten mad in a mood Now, Shotty’s back in the room, you’re not the Adam we knew This constant angst is problematic, what’s the matter? Drop the act This rotten apple’s, gotten bad, he’s lost and tangled, shocking tact, you’re not a man you’re a youth That’s not what adults should do Acting like everyone’s against him, what an arrogant view Like you’re the center of attention? Your logic has to improve Not everybody’s a snake, a shocking fact, but it’s true When you fall out with everyone then the common factor is you You fuck up relationships the moment you activate a computer Turning friends you keep into enemies and those actions make you a user Think St. Patricks Day, I banish snakes, I am the saint of the future I keep ahead (a head) of serpents like Perseus decapitating Medusa So don’t let his bullshit blur your vision Don’t be intimidated by a word he’s written Cause what he writes isn’t true like tabloid journalism So don’t be scared, most Horroh’s (horror) stories are a work of fiction Round 2: Shotty Horroh Hes alright, isnt he? Probably someone with a case for the top 4 Not many can joke as good as him You normally know Im goin to win But today...you arent sure Thats fine Bastards Hes a formidable opponent Youre just livin in the moment That graveyards been nothin but rusty chains and locked doors Until Brizzy said, Look Shuffle over, well then I made space for one more The most, one dimensional rapper in the scene For the last ten years hes given us nothin fresh Just copies Ricky Gervais whole shit and makes it rhyme...Im unimpressed I dont need to watch a Shuffle battle to tell you what couldve happened, its formulaic, I couldve guessed Funny how youre called Shuffle when we always know whats comin next I catch Shuffle while he teaches his little Rhyme & Rap Beginner classes Slidin past the guy who asked for ticket passes With a knife thats stashed within my jacket Slicin, drive the jagged shiv I fashioned inside his ab, his livers splashed Drive it back The skin is rugged like the shank its gettin traction You was battlin bowls of fuckin Fanta They kinda clash as mirror matches Cause youre both full of gas And the thumb and index is somethin I can actually twist ya cap with Try me, try me, try me Act as if Im chattin, dont die for rap cause its in fashion They wanted Shuffle in the graveyard Now its time for Michael Jackson Thriller dances I heard, Shuffles outside Lets get this Muppet outlined I dont give a fuck about rhymes I got this  gun  from round mines Me and my cousin, downsized Its just us and a brown ride ? Foot in his house like, Give it up or your pal dies. And Marlo stood there like, like, I dont mean to trouble you now guys But Ive got lunch at about 5:00 and another function around 9:00 Im just worried about time Gun butt him Outlines Blood comin out his mouth like you asked Gunna about slime Aim at Shuffle, and Shuffle outcries Are you guys gonna fuckin shoot me?! {gun cocks} What does it sound like? And Marlo stood there...joke Fuck that! Im outrageous If I dont impress Shuffle, I press Shuffle without playlist Im the sensei Whats a sensation to an out station Where would you have gotten without favors? Lets talk foundations Theres a difference between rock bottom and ground breakers If I wouldve showed up today without patience, youd be an outpatient Ahh Mortician, Shuffle on the table without Vegas I am thee, without a doubt greatest Out of town blazin, an ounce ? Youre just me, without flavor Downgraded, outdated Shotty, Tony, Soul, Kruger, Bizzo, Bobby, Unan, youre about 8ish Wait, thats without Arkaic, I cant downplay him Fuck Shuffle T! Ive been talkin smokin, Loud statements DJ with the drop on him, Shuffle on the floor like house ravers You rhyme words together really well Thats why the people love you, but thats just one piece of the secret puzzle Thats like missin the sea cause you see the puddle Thats where you seem to struggle You perform like your knees were buckled if you even push up a feeble muscle YOU let him do this with no conviction Just like if someone looks like him finds himself in legal trouble He stays insecure, stood on the spot lookin like he needs a cuddle as he speaks so discrete and subtle Thats why we dont believe in ya So many elite MCs that leagues above ya We dont in Shuffle like the deals a hustle You get it, but that aint the gamblin part I told Briggzy were gonna need a proper Shuffle or its gonna damage the card You think pretending to not have an ego is the cheat code Like its an invincible spell He thinks that if any MC is givin him hell he just needs to giggle as well and it isnt an L All that nonchalant shit of you bein the biggest you could be If you dont believe it, we dont believe it as well I mean all that self deprecating only made you be little (belittle) yourself Second round in, safe star bless Only one more round and plenty more space in that graveyard left Round 2: Shuffle T {Shuffle pulls out his phone} Hey, yeah, um, can I speak to someone in HR? Yeah its to deal with well-being and safeguards 2-9-1-5 is the number on my name card My place of work is Shotty Horroh’s Graveyard My complaints are - I never get told when a new shipment of bodies is coming in...which is a great start I just have to wait for them to magically pop up on my radar And I think he’s in denial cause, I know where the graves are And he always saying that he isnt, but he is running out of space fast If we ask too many questions he forces us out He turns up some days and orders us round He was meant to be in for a meeting at a quarter to...now Some are saying he won’t show up That’s what people are saying Its a hassle, its a stress, its havoc, its a mess I just get batches of the dead turn up through National Express And if I ask how they died that’s a sackable offence Am I to believe that he...What? Rap battles them to death? I’m calling today cause I’ve just had someone through, Tali Another hopeless victim And I’m looking around and I’ve got no idea for the life of me where I’m s’posed to fit him Plot 3? No that’s taken. It’s taken it don’t need filling Well, I can put Tali in there but he’s going to have Tony with him I get that these things are best handled with stealth It’s just - it’s extra stress for me, which is bad for my health But I guess I’ve just got to deal with the hand I was dealt What was your name? Alright, Briggzy, well thanks for your help. Listen, Im glad hes laughin, cause usually hes terrifying When he does smile, his Face ID doesn’t recognize him That, and youve put on a ? amount of weight A bit of padding around the face Youre the man of the house, its great I bet your calorie counts insane But Im not intimidated by you, that wasnt how I was raised I dont feel fear next to you, I just feel massively out of shape Now, he DID beat me in that film  VS  – but it was hard for me to lose that Cause I first wrote my side of the battle they said, “We can’t really use that It needs to be WORSE than Shotty’s material, so can you write us a new rap?” I said, “WORSE than Shotty’s stuff…? I don’t know if I can do that.” In the end I had to go through about 100,000 scripts To make my stuff as bad as what’s coming out that fucking mouth of his At one point I just screwed up a piece of paper and rubbed it round in shit The director said, “I think we’ll need to dumb it down a bit.” I was in  8 Mile  as well, you seen it? Ahh, its genius as fuck Producer called me personally said, “We need you for this, Shuff” I was meant to lose to Eminem, but the scenes have all been cut Apparently, me getting beat wasn’t “believable enough” Now listen, me and funny go together like bees and honey Easy money, Heretic and a vegan curry But it’s an understatement if youre describing me as ‘hungry’ That’s like calling Ian Huntley a ‘cheeky monkey’ I feel so comfy up here, I’m winning this in every round I should be getting out my armchair, slippers and a dressing gown You should bring Briggzy in as well, man! Fuck it, just for a laugh We can turn this in to a 1v1 and a half Cause look at all the people that you have to bring with you The second that a battle’s not inside of the M62 I could’ve had this battle in your house in your parent’s living room And have them both arguing over who they’d give it to Your mom gives it to me So, if I were you, I would honestly hide in a safe space Because this could cost you your life and that is fucking mate’s rates I am in here to have a couple of quick beers and slay I don’t care if the Sharks or the Knights are the ones that win here today Don’t get that misconstrued, I mean MY win’s clear on stage I just don’t care about the teams, cause I’m not 6 years of age Every performance I have out of 10 I give myself a million I am my own worst critic and I think I’m fucking brilliant! So fuck it, the rounds done, I got his back to the turnbuckle Let’s all see how many puns this cunt has for the word ‘shuffle’ Time Round 3: Shotty Horroh I mean Shuffle Ts funny as fuck Ive been quotin him when hes roastin them As far as the stand up comedy rap battle fans go, its either Oshea or him to be the GOAT for them But theres this Joe Pesci notion... Funny how? If you focusin Cause theres two types of funny in this world bro and youre both of em Cause youre funny, like youre funny when theyre lovin your clowin But youre funny like theres really somethin funny about him Cause I dont fuck my friends over You get bad luck from it Pussy try bein a stand up guy before you try bein a stand up comic Cause no matter what Cruger and Bags do for this lad, you know hes team Rowan forever He literally robbed your friends of their business pursuit as he DMd you, you instantly fold to the pressure Hes payin you with the money that he owes to them...dont act like you didnt know any better Crazy that you made a paperback when you was the staple that didnt have the spine to hold it together He does not give a fuck Ive never met anybody as bold as he is Can you imagine him, Cruger and Bagnall on Zoom if they host a meetin for the  Sound Like  show that evenin? And hes tangent off to Dont Flop, the whole case, the whole proceedings He sat there like, What a cunt. What a cunt. Sorry guys thats my phone. Hello Roooooo- Hello Ronan Keating Boys I have Ronan Keating. He does not give a fuck, you have to understand That shit he did with Liam and Freddie, that shit made em sick, they aint just anybodys Without them, I dont think the scene you see today exists Im not saying youre a piece of shit cause you didnt hold it down Im just sayin, you aint legit Cause he tried doin the same shit to my brother, and we squaded up and created this Loyal to the soil I dont fuck with anybody that wants to play with Briggz You dont like him, I dont you, simple, plain as shit Thats why our careers meet at a fork in the road, and they separate, like this Cause youre still maintainin a main event career and gettin a wage from it And Im the guy that pays you it And I did your little panel show for free twice It was COVID times I let the love persuade me You couldnt sell tickets, make money, there was no crowd, stuff was crazy You came at me with the whole were friends angle and I ? Cause me charging Shuffle shady Until we needed you during the pandemic and your attitude was fuck you pay me So fuck Shuffle T and his book and his infiltrating, gentrification in a class These posh cunts cant see what the streets created with the scraps And wanna turn it into data and a ? Click this link and learn how to be hip hop FUCK OFF! We aint got the patience for all a dat For your book to be useful to me, Id have to tape it to my abs so I was safe from gettin stabbed I didnt learn this shift from a fuckin book I was battlin on the street corner since I had a bus pass and pocket full of dust caps People hated, FUCK THAT I handled the positive and the negative like a blood bank Me versus you, 1 on 1 aint a good match Cause Ive always been a couple points above you like a umlaut Next thing I wanna talk about is very fuckin serious Its not a joke Cause I dont trust a man whos arms dont move when he walks Its one of those Why do your arms look so heavy bro? I gotta know You look like every single ? trying to carry your mums worth of shopping home Fuckin strange guy Lookin like the little  Men In Black  alien inside him cant operate the arms and the legs at the same time And thank you very much Another straight, white, male with a podcast With long hair and edgy jokes Its fuckin Russel off-Brand Thats me, thank you Round 3: Shuffle T Now your music has actually been a little different lately When you up and switch so fucking quick it comes across as shady That  Scum Of The Earth  album was so Oasis influenced it was crazy I said, “Do you think you might have ripped them off a bit?” He said “mayyyyyybeeeeeeee! I said, “Yeah,  Definitely Maybe Here’s what I think happened, I think you started copying them Little By Little Then you just Roll With It Head up in the clouds I mean he doesn’t hear it It makes him wonder what all (Wonderwall) the fuss is about No one’s more pissed off than me, I liked how your old albums sound In fact, I don’t believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now Dont Look Back In Anger You blended Brit pop and hip hop with rock Thought it would be shit hot, big shock, it’s not You ripped off a band you like, and yeah you did it beautifully But musically, now you’re nowhere near as good as it used to be Cause when you sell out your art for a dime It’ll never be far from your mind Cause when you’ve been cast to the side those steps are a bastard to climb You’re energy starved and you’ll try, but never regrasp on those heights Your penmanship starts to decline, your presence your bars and your lines And everything’s harder to rhyme Integrity’s hard to define But when you pretend to be part of a life Of the celebrity’s art that you like All you’re doing is karaoke, you dress up you dance and you mime So, all you’ve actually done is perfected the art of disguise That’s why you’re running out of smoke like a contestant on  Stars In Their Eyes Tonight Matthew, I’m going to shove Noel’s Gallagher’s dick in every hole that it can fit The only role that you can give, this ain’t a cold slap on the wrist You’re facing the whole character list of  Soul Caliber 6 That’s why he’s saying shit lines these days like It Tali and (Italian) blood run in the streets, oh my God, youre such a prick The Manny crowd were loving it, most people wouldn’t fuck with it I was just watching with a confused face, I couldn’t keep up with it Not because its too complex, just cause its fucking shit Italian blood running the streets – I’ll slow down I’m out maneuvering Im gettin a bit too complex so let me do some tutoring See I said something about the mafia, but I included in his pseudonym I don’t give a shit if you crammed his name in there it still has fuck all to do with him Let me say something simple and make it official Battle rap bars arent personal cause their name or initial was placed in the middle Every round from you these days is just this crazy horrid scheme You make it sound complex but it’s always just the same obnoxious theme People used to be able to battle in a way they’d want to speak Whatever happened to just fucking saying what you mean? Every line it’s “I said one thing that sounds like another thing. Isnt that clever?” I’m just watching from the side like “Mate. It isn’t that clever.” So, I won’t dress this up with word play I’ll just tell you what the truth is I think insecurity is the reason you became a unit Your battles aren’t that great these days, neither is your music I think you’re overrated, and I think you’re fuckin stupid This is loud-mouth bullshit versus strong and silent You make something simple feel like rocket science I make rocket science feel like comic timing Like Hugh Laurie,  The Two Ronnies  or  Monty Python It doesn’t make an ounce of difference how you spin it Which way round you flip it, upside down and twisted I am bound to win this, and the crowd can witness This counterfeited coward’s limits There’s always praise for you and you’re showered with it Put on a pedestal like some proud exhibit They put you in the top 4 they’ve mapped out your image Well, you can have Mount Rushmore I’ll take Mount Olympus You say I’m a clown as if it means that I’m annoyed I love that reputation, thats my pride and joy So, go find some roids, alright? Enjoy! Take that belt to its biting point I’ll just kick you in the bollocks with my clown shoes so hard you’ll have a higher voice than a choirboy’s! If you’re watching from overseas – watch more UK battle rap Watch Frankie, Frost, Oshea, Cojay, Gemini, It’s action packed Watch Premier Battles, Dont Flop, No Loose Chat, fuck it - watch some Danny Jaqq Just stop giving all your attention to this overrated fuckin twat! See, I beat you with word play, angles, aggression, concepts, this battle’s what I make it You just forever rely on Americanized generically rhymed name flips You’re an imitator – you see what’s out there and you claim it I’m an innovator – I see what’s out there and I change it Time"
The Weeknd,Save Your Tears,"Intro Ooh Na-na, yeah Verse 1 I saw you dancing in a crowded room (Uh) You look so happy when Im not with you But then you saw me, caught you by surprise A single teardrop falling from your eye Refrain I dont know why I run away I make you cry when I run away Verse 2 You couldve asked me why I broke your heart You couldve told me that you fell apart But you walked past me like I wasnt there And just pretended like you didnt care Refrain I dont know why I run away I make you cry when I run away Pre-Chorus Take me back cause I wanna stay Save your tears for another Chorus Save your tears for another day Save your tears for another day (So) Verse 3 I made you think that I would always stay I said some things that I should never say Yeah, I broke your heart like someone did to mine And now you wont love me for a second time Refrain I dont know why I run away, oh, girl Said, I make you cry when I run away Pre-Chorus Girl, take me back cause I wanna stay Save your tears for another I realize that Im much too late And you deserve someone better Chorus Save your tears for another day (Oh yeah) Save your tears for another day (Yeah) Refrain I dont know why I run away Ill make you cry when I run away Chorus Save your tears for another day Ooh, girl, I said (Ah) Save your tears for another day (Ah) Outro Save your tears for another day (Ah) Save your tears for another day (Ah)"
Journey,Don't Stop Believin',"Verse 1 Just a small-town girl, livin in a lonely world She took the midnight train goin anywhere Just a city boy, born and raised in South Detroit He took the midnight train goin anywhere Verse 2 A singer in a smoky room The smell of wine and cheap perfume For a smile, they can share the night It goes on and on and on and on Chorus Strangers waitin Up and down the boulevard Their shadows searchin in the night Streetlights, people Livin just to find emotion Hidin somewhere in the night Verse 3 Workin hard to get my fill Everybody wants a thrill Payin anything to roll the dice Just one more time Verse 4 Some will win, some will lose Some are born to sing the blues Oh, the movie never ends It goes on and on and on and on Chorus Strangers waitin Up and down the boulevard Their shadows searchin in the night Streetlights, people Livin just to find emotion Hidin somewhere in the night Guitar Solo Outro Dont stop   believin Hold on to that feelin Streetlights, people Dont stop  believin Hold on Streetlights, people Dont stop believin Hold on to that feelin Streetlights, people"

Adele,Someone Like You,"Verse 1 I heard that youre settled down That you found a girl and youre married now I heard that your dreams came true Guess she gave you things I didnt give to you Old friend, why are you so shy? Aint like you to hold back or hide from the light Pre-Chorus I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited But I couldnt stay away, I couldnt fight it I had hoped youd see my face And that youd be reminded that for me, it isnt over Chorus Never mind, Ill find someone like you I wish nothing but the best for you, too Dont forget me, I beg I remember you said Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead Verse 2 You know how the time flies Only yesterday was the time of our lives We were born and raised in a summer haze Bound by the surprise of our glory days Pre-Chorus I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited But I couldnt stay away, I couldnt fight it I had hoped youd see my face And that youd be reminded that for me, it isnt over Chorus Never mind, Ill find someone like you I wish nothing but the best for you, too Dont forget me, I beg I remember you said Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead Bridge Nothing compares, no worries or cares Regrets and mistakes, theyre memories made Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste? Chorus Never mind, Ill find someone like you I wish nothing but the best for you Dont forget me, I beg I remember you said Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead Never mind, Ill find someone like you I wish nothing but the best for you, too Dont forget me, I beg I remember you said Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead"

Eminem,Till I Collapse,"Intro: Eminem ( Yo, left, yo, left ) Cause sometimes you just feel tired ( Yo, left, right, left ) Feel weak, and when you feel weak ( Yo, left, yo, left ) You feel like you wanna just give up ( Yo, left, right, left ) But you gotta search within you ( Yo, left, yo, left ) Try to find that inner strength and just pull that shit out of you ( Yo, left, right, left ) And get that motivation to not give up ( Yo, left, yo, left ) And not be a quitter ( Yo, left, right, left ) No matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse Verse 1: Eminem Til I collapse, Im spillin these raps long as you feel em Til the day that I drop, youll never say that Im not killin em Cause when I am not, then Ima stop pennin em And I am not hip-hop and Im just not Eminem Subliminal thoughts, when Ima stop sendin em? Women are caught in webs, spin em and hock venom Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin to stop Amoxicillins just not real enough The criminal, cop-killin, hip-hop villain A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners Youre comin with me, feel it or not Youre gonna fear it like I showed ya the spirit of God lives in us You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzin up? Fa shizzle, my wizzle, this is the plot, listen up You bizzles forgot, Slizzle does not give a fuck Chorus: Nate Dogg &  Eminem  Til the roof comes off, til the lights go out Til my legs give out, cant shut my mouth Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps Ima rip this shit til my bones collapse Til the roof comes off, til the lights go out (Til the roof,  until the roof ) Til my legs give out, cant shut my mouth (The roof comes off,  the roof comes off ) Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps  (Til my legs,  until my legs ) Ima rip this shit til my bones collapse (Give out from underneath me) Verse 2: Eminem Music is like magic, theres a certain feelin you get When you real and you spit, and people are feelin your shit This is your moment, and every single minute you spend Tryna hold on to it, cause you may never get it again So while youre in it, try to get as much shit as you can And when your run is over, just admit when its at its end Cause Im at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in I got a list, heres the order of my list that its in It goes:   Reggie,   JAY-Z, 2Pac and Biggie André from OutKast,   Jada,   Kurupt,   Nas,   and then me But in this industry Im the cause of a lot of envy So when Im not put on this list, the shit does not offend me Thats why you see me walk around like nothings botherin me Even though half you people got a fuckin problem with me You hate it, but you know respect you got to give me The presss wet dream, like Bobby and Whitney— Nate, hit me! Chorus: Nate Dogg &  Eminem  Til the roof comes off, til the lights go out Til my legs give out, cant shut my mouth Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps Ima rip this shit til my bones collapse Til the roof comes off, til the lights go out (Til the roof,  until the roof ) Til my legs give out, cant shut my mouth (The roof comes off,  the roof comes off ) Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps  (Til my legs,  until my legs ) Ima rip this shit til my bones collapse (Give out from underneath me) Verse 3: Eminem Soon as a verse starts, I eat at an MCs heart What is he thinking? How not to go against me, smart And its absurd how people hang on every word Ill probly never get the props I feel I ever deserve But Ill never be served, my spot is forever reserved If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothin could ever be worse Thats why Im clever when I put together every verse My thoughts are sporadic,   I act like Im an addict I rap like Im addicted to smack like Im Kim Mathers But I dont wanna go forth and back in constant battles The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers So this is like a full-blown attack Im launchin at em The track is on some battlin raps, who wants some static? Cause I dont really think that the fact that Im Slim matters A plaque and platinum status is wack if Im not the baddest, so Chorus: Nate Dogg &  Eminem  Til the roof comes off, til the lights go out Til my legs give out, cant shut my mouth Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps Ima rip this shit til my bones collapse Til the roof comes off, til the lights go out (Til the roof,  until the roof ) Til my legs give out, cant shut my mouth (The roof comes off,  the roof comes off ) Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps  (Til my legs,  until my legs ) Ima rip this shit til my bones collapse (Give out from underneath me) Outro: Eminem,  Nate Dogg  &  Eminem & Nate Dogg  Until the roof,  until the roof The roof comes off,  the roof comes off Until my legs,  until my legs Give out from  underneath me, I I will not fall, I will stand tall Feels like no one can beat me"

Eminem,Godzilla (feat. Juice WRLD),"Ох, да ты просто монстр Куплет 1: Dicon Я могу выпить бутылку. Алкоголь - и я, словно Гадзилла Попаду в колоду, будто крупье в казино Весь мой сквад тут на тусе ходит туда-сюда Помесь зомби апокалипсиса и Бобби Хинана Мозга я Ведь со мной вновь сражается также моя же мания Shady вернулся, взрывать пора Говоришь, от меня клонит в сон тебя? Вот тогда тебе бессоница У тебя дефицит внимания, успокойся и слушай сейчас меня Чел, выпей коньяка Убью из АК с кулака, для меня это не больше, чем игра Отсякай, видишь меня отступай, тут орёт тревога Этот бит сумасшедший, смешной (хах), как будто Ray J Угараю по дороге до банка, брызжа слюной, вам не успокоить Во мне... Припев: Dicon Монстра Встанешь на пути моём, скормлю тебя монстру Весь день такой как ты, но ночью превращаюсь в монстра При свете луны, что сияет так ясно Я становлюсь злодеем. Это мой блокбастер Гадзилла, всё в огне, я монстр В крови ковёр луи ви, в крови весь танцпол Всё горит, Гадзилла, всё в огне, я монстр В крови ковёр луи ви, в крови весь танцпол Куплет 2: Dicon Я лишь продукт Слика Рика из Оникса, своим треком их ужасну Разозлю, хоть их сотни всех. Невозможно даже перечесть И вдобавок ко всему этому я в психушке в руках верчу Магический шар В попытках узнать, каково будет завтра: После рисперидона будет ли шанс? Мой кулак, будто карандаш, чертит круги на стене Черти кричат все во мне Эта песня даст веру тебе Ты направил свой ствол на парня с базукой в руке Я из Лох-Несса вылез, прямо из мифов Как только грохну свой полтиник водки Лишь откручу крышку, ты увидишь... Припев: Dicon Монстра Встанешь на пути моём, скормлю тебя монстру Весь день такой как ты, но ночью превращаюсь в монстра При свете луны, что сияет так ясно Я становлюсь злодеем. Это мой блокбастер Гадзилла, всё в огне, я монстр В крови ковёр луи ви, в крови весь танцпол Всё горит, Гадзилла, всё в огне, я монстр В крови ковёр луи ви, в крови весь танцпол Куплет 3: Dicon Если тебе так же пох, руки вверх! Ведь я уже собрался в отдых. Бэд Трип подъехал Нахожусь на месте, как мой индекс, теперь всё, что ты увидишь Лишь мой средний палец, подниму выше! Как у меня могут быть только фаны? Горю, как у лжеца память Я не думал вас даже оставить без восхищений текстами И эти дамы прекрасны, меня заводят опасно И я их очаровал всех, они теряют сознание И всё снова крутится, крутится, словно цепь бензопилы Я машу волшебной палочкой, как битой, исполню мечты Сука, я сделал эти бабки слишком просто как Кид Инк Называй меня Дидди Создаю группы, что мне дают прибыль Слышь, я в игре, скуп на делёж, что принадлежит мне Я не дам слова тебе, не притворюсь даже, мэн Но я сказал суке, что женюсь на ней, если она после будет в земле Я как Ричард Рамирес ебашу людей Не стою на месте, как Кристиан Ривера Все мои тексты вихляют подобно мне Как при параличе, это страшно, я зову что Гарри Карей Ведь каждый Том. Дик и Гарри всегда имеют грёбанный словарь при себе Это смешно и нелепо. Ведь они подобно мне Трясутся над ним, божатся, клянутся над ним Пришло время пересечься с глазу на глаз с этой острой проблемой Пора быстрее, составить некролог о каждом. Теперь и мне похер, поверь Пора палить, зарядил ствол, полон чернил он Злая половина меня сместит вновь, и людей привлекают мои тексты всё ещё Он смотрят на них, как на гангстеров Будто я буду щас стрелять всех Каждый трей, как джингл, в магазин вложил их Теперь пришло время их всех положить! Наполняю ядом и рядом перебиваю Другими словами, я из них соки выжимаю Не хотел убивать всех, но я в приступе ярости Ты не в силах сбежать теперь, я не чувствую жалости Они меня ненавидят, и я не знаю усталости, и вот я настигаю их И перемалываю в ярости Я чувствую, будто бы стал на голову тронутым, во мне демон И я знаю, он по крови их голоден Либо ты убиваешь, либо убит будешь скоро ты, я подорву тебя И раскидаю в разные стороны Моя каждая часть сделана из зла и насилия Если ты меня увидишь, то поверь, ты бессилен Убегай или молись, но никак не беси меня, или в ту же минуту Я разорву на куски тебя Ты не станешь как я даже на пару процентов Я собираюсь покончить с тобой, ты знаешь об этом Меня подобные тебе вызывают на бэттл, но я не победим Вовсе не убиваем и неподелен Переделываю строки и не знаю предела я У меня есть много денег, они раскиданы в трейлере Я не боюсь потянутся за моим... Чел стой Смотри что в планах! Хах"

The memory of oppressed people is one thing that cannot be taken away, and for such people, with such memories, revolt is always an inch below the surface. For blacks in the United States, there was the memory of slavery, and after that of segregation, lynching, humiliation. And it was not just a memory but a living presence-part of the daily lives of blacks in generation after generation. In the 1930s, Langston Hughes wrote a poem, Lenox Avenue Mural: What happens to a dream deferred? Does it dry up like  a raisin in the sun? Or fester like a sore- And then run? Does it stink like rotten meat? Or crust and sugar over- like a syrupy sweet? Maybe it just sags like a heavy load. Or does it explode? In a society of complex controls, both crude and refined, secret thoughts can often he found in the arts, and so it was in black society. Perhaps the blues, however pathetic, concealed anger; and the jazz, however joyful, portended rebellion. And then the poetry, the thoughts no longer so secret. In the 1920s, Claude McKay, one of the figures of what came to be called the  Harlem Renaissance,  wrote a poem that Henry Cabot Lodge put in the Congressional Record as an example of dangerous currents among young blacks: If we must die, let it not be like hogs hunted and penned in an inglorious spot. . .. Like men well face the murderous cowardly pack, Pressed to the wall, dying, but fighting back! Countee Cullens poem Incident evoked memories-all different, all the same-out of every black Americans childhood: Once riding in old Baltimore, Heart-filled, head-filled with glee, I saw a Baltimorean Keep looking straight at me. Now I was eight and very small, And he was no whit bigger, And so I smiled, but he poked out His tongue, and called me, Nigger, I saw the whole of Baltimore From May until December; Of all the things that happened there Thats all that I remember. At the time of the Scottsboro Boys incident,  Cullen wrote a bitter poem noting that white poets had used their pens to protest in other cases of injustice, but now that blacks were involved, most were silent. His last stanza was: Surely, I said, Now will the poets sing. But they have raised no cry. I wonder why. Even outward subservience-Uncle Tom behavior in real situations, the comic or fawning Negro on the stage, the self-ridicule, the caution-concealed resentment, anger, energy.  The black poet Paul Laurence Dunbar, in the era of the black minstrel, around the turn of the century, wrote We Wear the Mask: We wear the mask that grins and lies, It hides our cheeks and shades our eyes,- . . . We sing, but oh, the clay is vile Beneath our feet, and long the mile; But let the world dream otherwise, We wear the mask. Two black performers of that time played the minstrel and satirized it at the same time. When Bert Williams and George Walker billed themselves as Two Real Coons, they were, Nathan Huggins says, intending to give style and comic dignity to a fiction that white men had created.... By the 1930s the mask was off for many black poets. Langston Hughes wrote I, Too. I, too, sing America I am the darker brother. They send me to eat in the kitchen When company comes, But I laugh, And eat well, And grow strong. Tomorrow, Ill be at the table When company comes. . .. Gwendolyn Bennett wrote: I want to see lithe Negro girls, Etched dark against the sky While sunset lingers. ... I want to hear the chanting Around a heathen fire Of a strange black race.... I want to feel the surging Of my sad peoples soul Hidden by a minstrel-smile. There was Margaret Walkers prose-poem For My People: . . . Let a new earth rise. Let another world be born. Let a bloody peace be written in the sky. Let a second generation full of courage issue forth, let a people loving freedom come to growth, let a beauty full of healing and a strength of final clenching be the pulsing in our spirits and our blood. Let the martial songs be written, let the dirges disappear. Let a race of men now rise and take control! By the 1940s there was Richard Wright, a gifted novelist, a black man. His autobiography of 1937, Black Boy, gave endless insights: for instance, how blacks were set against one another, when he told how he was prodded to fight another black boy for the amusement of white men. Black Boy expressed unashamedly every humiliation and then: The white South said that it knew niggers, and I was what the white South called a nigger. Well, the white South had never known me-never known what I thought, what I felt. The white South said that I had a place in life. Well, I had never felt my place; or, rather, my deepest instincts had always made me reject the place to which the white South had assigned me. It had never occurred to me that I was in any way an inferior being. And no word that I had ever heard fall from the lips of southern white men had ever made me really doubt the worth of my own humanity. It was all there in the poetry, the prose, the music, sometimes masked, sometimes unmistakably clear-the signs of a people unbeaten, waiting, hot, coiled. In Black Boy, Wright told about the training of black children in America to keep them silent. But also: How do Negroes feel about the way they have to live? How do they discuss it when alone among themselves? I think this question can be answered in a single sentence, A friend of mine who ran an elevator once told me: Lawd, man! Ef it wuznt fer them polices n them ol lynch mobs, there wouldnt be nothin but uproar down here! Richard Wright, for a time, joined the Communist party (he tells of this period of his life, and his disillusionment with the party, in The God That Failed). The Communist party was known to pay special attention to the problem of race equality. When the Scottsboro case unfolded in the 1930s in Alabama, it was the Communist party that had become associated with the defense of these young black men imprisoned, in the early years of the Depression, by southern injustice. The party was accused by liberals and the NAACP of exploiting the issue for its own purposes, and there was a half-truth in it, but black people were realistic about the difficulty of having white allies who were pure in motive. The other half of the truth was that black Communists in the South had earned the admiration of blacks by their organizing work against enormous obstacles. There was Hosea Hudson, the black organizer of the unemployed in Birmingham, for instance. And in Georgia, in 1932, a nineteen-year-old black youth named Angelo Herndon, whose father died of miners pneumonia, who had worked in mines as a boy in Kentucky, joined an Unemployment Council in Birmingham organized by the Communist party, and then joined the party. He wrote later: All my life Id been sweated and stepped-on and Jim-Crowed. I lay on my belly in the mines for a few dollars a week, and saw my pay stolen and slashed, and my buddies killed. I lived in the worst section of town, and rode behind the Colored signs on streetcars, as though there was something disgusting about me. I heard myself called nigger and darky and I had to say Yes, sir to every white man, whether he had my respect or not. I had always detested it, but I had never known that anything could be done about it. And here, all of a sudden, I had found organizations in which Negroes and whites sat together, and worked together, and knew no difference of race or color. .. . Herndon became a Communist party organizer in Atlanta. He and his fellow Communists organized block committees of Unemployment Councils in 1932 which got rent relief for needy people. They organized a demonstration to which a thousand people came, six hundred of them white, and the next day the city voted $6,000 in relief to the jobless. But soon after that Herndon was arrested, held incommunicado, and charged with violating a Georgia statute against insurrection. He recalled his trial: The state of Georgia displayed the literature that had been taken from my room, and read passages of it to the jury. They questioned me in great detail. Did I believe that the bosses and government ought to pay insurance to unemployed workers? That Negroes should have complete equality with white people? Did I believe in the demand for the self- determination of the Black Belt - that the Negro people should be allowed to rule the Black Belt territory, kicking out the white landlords and government officials? Did I feel that the working- class could run the mills and mines and government? That it wasnt necessary to have bosses at all? I told them I believed all of that—and more. . .. Herndon was convicted and spent five years in prison until in 1937 the Supreme Court ruled unconstitutional the Georgia statute under which he was found guilty. It was men like him who represented to the Establishment a dangerous militancy among blacks, made more dangerous when linked with the Communist party. There were others who made that same connection, magnifying the danger: Benjamin Davis, the black lawyer who defended Herndon at his trial; nationally renowned men like  singer and actor Paul Robeson,  and  writer and scholar W. E. B. Du Bois,  who did not hide their support and sympathy for the Communist party. The Negro was not as anti-Communist as the white population. He could not afford to be, his friends were so few—so that Herndon, Davis, Robeson, Du Bois, however their political views might be maligned by the country as a whole, found admiration for their fighting spirit in the black community. The black militant mood, flashing here and there in the thirties, was reduced to a subsurface simmering during World War II, when the nation on the one hand denounced racism, and on the other hand maintained segregation in the armed forces and kept blacks in low-paying jobs. When the war ended, a new element entered the racial balance in the United States—the enormous, unprecedented upsurge of black and yellow people in Africa and Asia. President Harry Truman had to reckon with this, especially as the cold war rivalry with the Soviet Union began,  and the dark-skinned revolt of former colonies all over the world threatened to take Marxist form . Action on the race question was needed, not just to calm a black population at home emboldened by war promises, frustrated by the basic sameness of their condition, It was needed to present to the world a United States that could counter the continuous Communist thrust at the most flagrant failure of American society-the race question. What Du Bois had said long ago, unnoticed, now loomed large in 1945: The problem of the 20th century is the problem of the color line. President Harry Truman, in late 1946, appointed a Committee on Civil Rights, which recommended that the civil rights section of the Department of Justice be expanded, that there be a permanent Commission on Civil Rights, that Congress pass laws against lynching and to stop voting discrimination, and suggested new laws to end racial discrimination in jobs. Trumans Committee was blunt about its motivation in making these recommendations. Yes, it said, there was moral reason: a matter of conscience. But there was also an economic reason- discrimination was costly to the country, wasteful of its talent. And, perhaps most important, there was an international reason: Our position in the post-war world is so vital to the future that our smallest actions have tar- reaching effects. .. . We cannot escape the fact that our civil rights record has been an issue in world politics. The worlds press and radio are full of it. . ., Those with competing philosophies have stressed-and are shamelessly distorting-our shortcomings. . . . They have tried to prove our democracy an empty fraud, and our nation a consistent oppressor of underprivileged people. This may seem ludicrous to Americans, but it is sufficiently important to worry our friends. The United States is not so strong, the final triumph of the democratic ideal is not so inevitable that we can ignore what the world thinks of us or our record. The United States was out in the world now in a way it had never been. The stakes were large—world supremacy. And, as Trumans Committee said: ...our smallest actions have far-reaching effects. And so the United States went ahead to take small actions, hoping they would have large effects. Congress did not move to enact the legislation asked for by the Committee on Civil Rights. But Truman—four months before the presidential election of 1948, and challenged from the left in that election by Progressive party candidate Henry Wallace—issued an executive order asking that the armed forces, segregated in World War II, institute policies of racial equality as rapidly as possible. The order may have been prompted not only by the election but by the need to maintain black morale in the armed forces, as the possibility of war grew. It took over a decade to complete the desegregation in the military. Truman could have issued executive orders in other areas, but did not. The Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, plus the set of laws passed in the late 1860s and early 1870s, gave the President enough authority to wipe out racial discrimination. The Constitution demanded that the President execute the laws, but no President had used that power. Neither did Truman. For instance, he asked Congress for legislation prohibiting discrimination in interstate transportation facilities; but specific legislation in 1887 already barred discrimination in interstate transportation and had never been enforced by executive action. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court was taking steps-ninety years after the Constitution had been amended to establish racial equality-to move toward that end. During the war it ruled that the white primary used to exclude blacks from voting in the Democratic party primaries- which in the South were really the elections-was unconstitutional. In 1954, the Court finally struck down the separate but equal doctrine that it had defended since the 1890s. The NAACP brought a series of cases before the Court to challenge segregation in the public schools, and now in Brown v. Board of Education the Court said the separation of schoolchildren generates a feeling of inferiority .. . that may affect their hearts and minds in a way unlikely ever to be undone. In the field of public education, it said, the doctrine of separate but equal has no place. The Court did not insist on immediate change: a year later it said that segregated facilities should he integrated with all deliberate speed. By 1965, ten years after the all deliberate speed guideline, more than 75 percent of the school districts in the South remained segregated. Still, it was a dramatic decision—and the message went around the world in 1954 that the American government had outlawed segregation. In the United States too, for those not thinking about the customary gap between word and fact, it was an exhilarating sign of change. What to others seemed rapid progress to blacks was apparently not enough. In the early 1960s black people rose in rebellion all over the South. And in the late 1960s they were engaging in wild insurrection in a hundred northern cities. It was all a surprise to those without that deep memory of slavery, that everyday presence of humiliation, registered in the poetry, the music, the occasional outbursts of anger, the more frequent sullen silences. Part of that memory was of words uttered, laws passed, decisions made, which turned out to be meaningless. For such a people, with such a memory, and such daily recapitulation of history, revolt was always minutes away, in a timing mechanism which no one had set, but which might go off with some unpredictable set of events. Those events came, at the end of 1955, in the capital city of Alabama- Montgomery. Three months after her arrest, Mrs. Rosa Parks, a forty-three-year-old seamstress, explained why she refused to obey the Montgomery law providing for segregation on city buses, why she decided to sit down in the white section of the bus: Well, in the first place, I had been working all day on the job. I was quite tired after spending a full day working. I handle and work on clothing that white people wear. That didnt come in my mind but this is what I wanted to know: when and how would we ever determine our rights as human beings? ... It just happened that the driver made a demand and I just didnt feel like obeying his demand. He called a policeman and I was arrested and placed in jail.... Montgomery blacks called a mass meeting. A powerful force in the community was F. D. Nixon, a veteran trade unionist and experienced organizer. There was a vote to boycott all city buses. Car pools were organized to take Negroes to work; most people walked. The city retaliated by indicting one hundred leaders of the boycott, and sent many to jail. White segregationists turned to violence. Bombs exploded in four Negro churches. A shotgun blast was fired through the front door of the home of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., the twenty-seven-year-old Altanta-born minister who was one of the leaders of the boycott. Kings home was bombed. But the black people of Montgomery persisted, and in November 1956, the Supreme Court outlawed segregation on local bus lines. Montgomery was the beginning. It forecast the style and mood of the vast protest movement that would sweep the South in the next ten years: emotional church meetings, Christian hymns adapted to current battles, references to lost American ideals, the commitment to nonviolence, the willingness to struggle and sacrifice. A New York Times reporter described a mass meeting in Montgomery during the boycott: One after the other, indicted Negro leaders took the rostrum in a crowded Baptist church tonight to urge their followers to shun the citys buses and walk with God. More than two thousand Negroes filled the church from basement to balcony and overflowed into the street. They chanted and sang; they shouted and prayed; they collapsed in the aisles and they sweltered in an eighty-five degree heat. They pledged themselves again and again to passive resistance. Under this banner they have carried on for eighty days a stubborn boycott of the citys buses. Martin Luther King at that meeting gave a preview of the oratory that would soon inspire millions of people to demand racial justice. He said the protest was not merely over buses but over things that go deep down into the archives of history. He said: We have known humiliation, we have known abusive language, we have been plunged into the abyss of oppression. And we decided to raise up only with the weapon of protest. It is one of the greatest glories of America that we have the right of protest. If we are arrested every day, if we are exploited every day, if we are trampled over every day, dont ever let anyone pull you so low as to hate them. We must use the weapon of love. We must have compassion and understanding for those who hate us. We must realize so many people are taught to hate us that they are not totally responsible for their hate. But we stand in life at midnight, we are always on the threshold of a new dawn. Kings stress on love and nonviolence was powerfully effective in building a sympathetic following throughout the nation, among whites as well as blacks. But there were blacks who thought the message naive, that while there were misguided people who might be won over by love, there were others who would have to be bitterly fought, and not always with nonviolence. Two years after the Montgomery boycott, in Monroe, North Carolina, an ex-marine named Robert Williams, the president of the local NAACP, became known for his view that blacks should defend themselves against violence, with guns if necessary. When local Klansmen attacked the home of one of the leaders of the Monroe NAACP, Williams and other blacks, armed with rifles, fired back. The Klan left. (The Klan was being challenged now with its own tactic of violence; a Klan raid on an Indian community in North Carolina was repelled by Indians firing rifles.) Still, in the years that followed, southern blacks stressed nonviolence. On February 1, 1960, four freshmen at a Negro college in Greensboro, North Carolina, decided to sit down at the Woolworths lunch counter downtown, where only whites ate. They were refused service, and when they would not leave, the lunch counter was closed for the day. The next day they returned, and then, day after day, other Negroes came to sit silently. In the next two weeks, sit-ins spread to fifteen cities in five southern states. A seventeen-year-old sophomore at Spelman College in Atlanta, Ruby Doris Smith, heard about Greensboro: When the student committee was formed . .. I told my older sister ... to put me on the list. And when two hundred students were selected for the first demonstration I was among them. I went through the food line in the restaurant at the State Capitol with six other students, but when we got to the cashier she wouldnt take our money. .. . The Lieutenant-Governor came down and told us to leave. We didnt and went to the county jail. In his Harlem apartment in New York, a young Negro teacher of mathematics named Bob Moses saw a photo in the newspapers of the Greensboro sit-inners. The students in that picture had a certain look on their faces, sort of sullen, angry, determined. Before, the Negro in the South had always looked on the defensive, cringing. This time they were taking the initiative. They were kids my age, and I knew this had something to do with my own life. There was violence against the sit-inners. But the idea of taking the initiative against segregation took hold. In the next twelve months, more than fifty thousand people, mostly black, some white, participated in demonstrations of one kind or another in a hundred cities, and over 3,600 people were put in jail. But by the end of 1960, lunch counters were open to blacks in Greensboro and many other places. A year after the Greensboro incident, a northern-based group dedicated to racial equality—CORE (Congress of Racial Equality)—organized Freedom Rides in which blacks and whites traveled together on buses going through the South, to try to break the segregation pattern in interstate travel. Such segregation had long been illegal, but the federal government never enforced the law in the South; the President now was John F. Kennedy, but he too seemed cautious about the race question, concerned about the support of southern white leaders of the Democratic party. The two buses that left Washington, D.C., on May 4, 1963, headed for New Orleans, never got there. In South Carolina, riders were beaten. In Alabama, a bus was set afire. Freedom Riders were attacked with fists and iron bars. The southern police did not interfere with any of this violence, nor did the federal government. FBI agents watched, took notes, did nothing. At this point, veterans of the sit-ins, who had recently formed the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), dedicated to nonviolent but militant action for equal rights, organized another Freedom Ride, from Nashville to Birmingham. Before they started out, they called the Department of Justice in Washington, D.C., to ask for protection. As Ruby Doris Smith reported: . . . the Justice Department said no, they couldnt protect anyone, but if something happened, they would investigate. You know how they do.... The racially mixed SNCC Freedom Riders were arrested in Birmingham, Alabama, spent a night in jail, were taken to the Tennessee border by police, made their way back to Birmingham, took a bus to Montgomery, and there were attacked by whites with fists and clubs, in a bloody scene. They resumed their trip, to Jackson, Mississippi. By this time the Freedom Riders were in the news all over the world, and the government was anxious to prevent further violence. Attorney General Robert Kennedy, instead of insisting on their right to travel without being arrested, agreed to the Freedom Riders being arrested in Jackson, in return for Mississippi police protection against possible mob violence. As Victor Navasky comments in Kennedy Justice, about Robert Kennedy: He didnt hesitate to trade the freedom riders constitutional right to interstate travel for Senator Eastlands guarantee of their right to live. The Freedom Riders did not become subdued in jail. They resisted, protested, sang, demanded their rights. Stokely Carmichael recalled later how he and his fellow inmates were singing in the Parchman jail in Mississippi and the sheriff threatened to take away their mattresses: I hung on to the mattress and said, I think we have a right to them and I think youre unjust. And he said, I dont want to hear all that shit, nigger, and started to put on the wristbreakers. I wouldnt move and started to sing Im Gonna Tell God How You Treat Me and everybody started to sing it, and by this time Tyson was really to pieces. He called to the trusties, Get him in there! and he went out the door and slammed it, and left everybody else with their mattresses. In Albany, Georgia, a small deep-South town where the atmosphere of slavery still lingered, mass demonstrations took place in the winter of 1961 and again in 1962. Of 22,000 black people in Albany, over a thousand went to jail for marching, assembling, to protest segregation and discrimination. Here, as in all the demonstrations that would sweep over the South, little black children participated-a new generation was learning to act. The Albany police chief, after one of the mass arrests, was taking the names of prisoners lined up before his desk. He looked up and saw a Negro boy about nine years old. Whats your name? The boy looked straight at him and said: Freedom, Freedom. There is no way of measuring the effect of that southern movement on the sensibilities of a whole generation of young black people, or of tracing the process by which some of them became activists and leaders. In Lee County, Georgia, after the events of 1961-1962, a black teenager named James Crawford joined SNCC and began taking black people to the county courthouse to vote. One day, bringing a woman there, he was approached by the deputy registrar. Another SNCC worker took notes on the conversation: REGISTRAR:	What do you want? CRAWFORD:	I brought this lady down to register. REGISTRAR:	(after giving the woman a card to fill out and sending her outside in the hall) Why did you bring this lady down here? CRAWFORD:	Because she wants to be a first class citizen like yall. REGISTRAR:	Who are you to bring people down to register? CRAWFORD:	Its my job. REGISTRAR:	Suppose you get two bullets in your head right now? CRAWFORD:	I got to die anyhow. REGISTRAR:	If I dont do it, I can get somebody else to do it. (No reply) REGISTRAR:	Are you scared? CRAWFORD:	No. REGISTRAR:	Suppose somebody came in that door and shoot you in the back of the head right now. What would you do? CRAWFORD:	I couldnt do nothing. If they shoot me in the back of the head there are people coming from all over the world. CRAWFORD:	What people? REGISTRAR:	The people I work for. In Birmingham in 1963, thousands of blacks went into the streets, facing police clubs, tear gas, dogs, high-powered water hoses. And meanwhile, all over the deep South, the young people of SNCC, mostly black, a few white, were moving into communities in Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas. Joined by local black people, they were organizing, to register people to vote, to protest against racism, to build up courage against violence. The Department of Justice recorded 1412 demonstrations in three months of 1963. Imprisonment became commonplace, beatings became frequent. Many local people were afraid. Others came forward. A nineteen-year- old black student from Illinois named Carver Neblett, working for SNCC in Terrell County, Georgia, reported: I talked with a blind man who is extremely interested in the civil rights movement. He has been keeping up with the movement from the beginning. Even though this man is blind he wants to learn all the questions on the literacy test. Imagine, while many are afraid that white men will burn our houses, shoot into them, or put us off their property, a blind man, seventy years old, wants to come to our meetings. As the summer of 1964 approached, SNCC and other civil rights groups working together in Mississippi, and facing increasing violence, decided to call upon young people from other parts of the country for help. They hoped that would bring attention to the situation in Mississippi. Again and again in Mississippi and elsewhere, the FBI had stood by, lawyers for the Justice Department had stood by, while civil rights workers were beaten and jailed, while federal laws were violated. On the eve of the Mississippi Summer, in early June 1964, the civil rights movement rented a theater near the White House, and a busload of black Mississippians traveled to Washington to testify publicly about the daily violence, the dangers facing the volunteers coming into Mississippi. Constitutional lawyers testified that the national government had the legal power to give protection against such violence. The transcript of this testimony was given to President Johnson and Attorney General Kennedy, accompanied by a request for a protective federal presence during the Mississippi Summer. There was no response. Twelve days after the public hearing, three civil rights workers, James Chaney, a young black Mississippian, and two white volunteers, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner, were arrested in Philadelphia, Mississippi, released from jail late at night, then seized, beaten with chains, and shot to death. Ultimately, an informers testimony led to jail sentences for the sheriff and deputy sheriff and others. That came too late. The Mississippi murders had taken place after the repeated refusal of the national government, under Kennedy or Johnson, or any other President, to defend blacks against violence. Dissatisfaction with the national government intensified. Later that summer, during the Democratic National Convention in Washington, Mississippi, blacks asked to be seated as part of the state delegation to represent the 40 percent of the states population who were black. They were turned down by the liberal Democratic leadership, including vice-presidential candidate Hubert Humphrey. Congress began reacting to the black revolt, the turmoil, the world publicity. Civil rights laws were passed in 1957, 1960, and 1964. They promised much, on voting equality, on employment equality, but were enforced poorly or ignored. In 1965, President Johnson sponsored and Congress passed an even stronger Voting Rights Law, this time ensuring on-the-spot federal protection of the right to register and vote. The effect on Negro voting in the South was dramatic. In 1952, a million southern blacks (20 percent of those eligible) registered to vote, In 1964 the number was 2 million- 40 percent. By 1968, it was 3 million, 60 percent—the same percentage as white voters. The federal government was trying—without making fundamental changes—to control an explosive situation, to channel anger into the traditional cooling mechanism of the ballot box, the polite petition, the officially endorsed quiet gathering. When black civil rights leaders planned a huge march on Washington in the summer of 1963 to protest the failure of the nation to solve the race problem, it was quickly embraced by President Kennedy and other national leaders, and turned into a friendly assemblage. Martin Luther Kings speech there thrilled 200,000 black and white Americans-I have a dream... It was magnificent oratory, but without the anger that many blacks felt. When John Lewis, a young Alabama-born SNCC leader, much arrested, much beaten, tried to introduce a stronger note of outrage at the meeting, he was censored by the leaders of the march, who insisted he omit certain sentences critical of the national government and urging militant action. Eighteen days after the Washington gathering, almost as if in deliberate contempt for its moderation, a bomb exploded in the basement of a black church in Birmingham and four girls attending a Sunday school class were killed. President Kennedy had praised the deep fervor and quiet dignity of the march, but the black militant Malcolm X was probably closer to the mood of the black community. Speaking in Detroit two months after the march on Washington and the Birmingham bombing, Malcolm X said, in his powerful, icy-clear, rhythmic style: The Negroes were out there in the streets. They were talking about how they were going to march on Washington.... That they were going to march on Washington, march on the Senate, march on the White House, march on the Congress, and tie it up, bring it to a halt, not let the government proceed. They even said they were going out to the airport and lay down on the runway and not let any airplanes land. Im telling you what they said. That was revolution. That was revolution. That was the black revolution. It was the grass roots out there in the street. It scared the white man to death, scared the white power structure in Washington, D.C. to death; I was there. When they found out that this black steamroller was going to come down on the capital, they called in ... these national Negro leaders that you respect and told them, Call it off, Kennedy said. Look you all are letting this thing go too far. And Old Tom said, Boss, I cant stop it because I didnt start it. Im telling you what they said. They said, Im not even in it, much less at the head of it. They said, These Negroes are doing things on their own. Theyre running ahead of us. And that old shrewd fox, he said, If you all arent in it, Ill put you in it. Ill put you at the head of it. Ill endorse it. Ill welcome it. Ill help it. Ill join it. This is what they did with the march on Washington. They joined it... became part of it, took it over. And as they took it over, it lost its militancy. It ceased to he angry, it ceased to be hot, it ceased to be uncompromising. Why, it even ceased to be a march. It became a picnic, a circus. Nothing but a circus, with clowns and all. . . No, it was a sellout. It was a takeover. ... They controlled it so tight, they told those Negroes what time to hit town, where to stop, what signs to carry, what song to sing, what speech they could make, and what speech they couldnt make, and then told them to get out of town by sundown.... The accuracy of Malcolm Xs caustic description of the march on Washington is corroborated in the description from the other side- from the Establishment, by White House adviser Arthur Schlesinger, in his book A Thousand Days. He tells how Kennedy met with the civil rights leaders and said the march would create an atmosphere of intimidation just when Congress was considering civil rights bills. A. Philip Randolph replied: The Negroes are already in the streets. It is very likely impossible to get them off.... Schlesinger says: The conference with the President did persuade the civil rights leaders that they should not lay siege to Capitol Hill. Schlesinger describes the Washington march admiringly and then concludes: So in 1963 Kennedy moved to incorporate the Negro revolution into the democratic coalition. ... But it did not work. The blacks could not be easily brought into the democratic coalition when bombs kept exploding in churches, when new civil rights laws did not change the root condition of black people. In the spring of 1963, the rate of unemployment for whites was 4.8 percent. For nonwhites it was 12.1 percent. According to government estimates, one-fifth of the white population was below the poverty line, and one-half of the black population was below that line. The civil rights bills emphasized voting, but voting was not a fundamental solution to racism or poverty. In Harlem, blacks who had voted for years still lived in rat-infested slums. In precisely those years when civil rights legislation coming out of Congress reached its peak, 1964 and 1965, there were black outbreaks in every part of the country: in Florida, set off by the killing of a Negro woman and a bomb threat against a Negro high school; in Cleveland, set off by the killing of a white minister who sat in the path of a bulldozer to protest discrimination against blacks in construction work; in New York, set off by the fatal shooting of a fifteen-year-old Negro boy during a fight with an off-duty policeman. There were riots also in Rochester, Jersey City, Chicago, Philadelphia. In August 1965, just as Lyndon Johnson was signing into law the strong Voting Rights Act, providing for federal registration of black voters to ensure their protection, the black ghetto in Watts, Los Angeles, erupted in the most violent urban outbreak since World War II. It was provoked by the forcible arrest of a young Negro driver, the clubbing of a bystander by police, the seizure of a young black woman falsely accused of spiting on the police. There was rioting in the streets, looting and firebombing of stores. Police and National Guardsmen were called in; they used their guns. Thirty-four people were killed, most of them black, hundreds injured, four thousand arrested. Robert Conot, a West Coast journalist, wrote of the riot (Rivers of Blood, Years of Darkness): In Los Angeles the Negro was going on record that he would no longer turn the other cheek. That, frustrated and goaded, he would strike back, whether the response of violence was an appropriate one or no. In the summer of 1966, there were more outbreaks, with rock throwing, looting, and fire bombing by Chicago blacks and wild shootings by the National Guard; three blacks were killed, one a thirteen-year-old boy, another a fourteen-year-old pregnant girl. In Cleveland, the National Guard was summoned to stop a commotion in the black community; four Negroes were shot to death, two by troopers, two by white civilians. It seemed clear by now that the nonviolence of the southern movement, perhaps tactically necessary in the southern atmosphere, and effective because it could be used to appeal to national opinion against the segregationist South, was not enough to deal with the entrenched problems of poverty in the black ghetto. In 1910, 90 percent of Negroes lived in the South. But by 1965, mechanical cotton pickers harvested 81 percent of Mississippi Delta cotton. Between 1940 and 1970, 4 million blacks left the country for the city. By 1965, 80 percent of blacks lived in cities and 50 percent of the black people lived in the North. There was a new mood in SNCC and among many militant blacks. Their disillusionment was expressed by a young black writer, Julius Lester: Now it is over. America has had chance after chance to show that it really meant that all men are endowed with certain inalienable rights. . .. Now it is over. The days of singing freedom songs and the days of combating bullets and billy clubs with love. . . . Love is fragile and gentle and seeks a like response. They used to sing I Love Everybody as they ducked bricks and bottles. Now they sing: Too much love, Too much love, Nothing kills a Nigger like Too much love. In 1967, in the black ghettos of the country, came the greatest urban riots of American history. According to the report of the National Advisory Committee on Urban Disorders, they involved Negroes acting against local symbols of white American society, symbols of authority and property in the black neighborhoods-rather than purely against white persons. The Commission reported eight major uprisings, thirty-three serious but not major outbreaks, and 123 minor disorders. Eighty-three died of gunfire, mostly in Newark and Detroit. The overwhelming majority of the persons killed or injured in all the disorders were Negro civilians. The typical rioter, according to the Commission, was a young, high school dropout but nevertheless, somewhat better educated than his non-rioting Negro neighbor and usually underemployed or employed in a menial job. He was proud of his race, extremely hostile to both whites and middle-class Negroes and, although informed about politics, highly distrustful of the political system. The report blamed white racism for the disorders, and identified the ingredients of the explosive mixture which has been accumulating in our cities since the end of World War II: Pervasive discrimination and segregation in employment, education, and housing .. . growing concentrations of impoverished Negroes in our major cities, creating a growing crisis of deteriorating facilities and services and unmet human needs. ... A new mood has sprung up among Negroes, particularly the young, in which self-esteem and enhanced racial pride are replacing apathy and submission to the system. But the Commission Report itself was a standard device of the system when facing rebellion: set up an investigating committee, issue a report; the words of the report, however strong, will have a soothing effect. That didnt completely work either. Black Power was the new slogan-an expression of distrust of any progress given or conceded by whites, a rejection of paternalism. Few blacks (or whites) knew the statement of the white writer Aldous Huxley: Liberties are not given, they are taken. But the idea was there, in Black Power. Also, a pride in race, an insistence on black independence, and often, on black separation to achieve this independence. Malcolm X was the most eloquent spokesman for this. After he was assassinated as he spoke on a public platform in February 1965, in a plan whose origins are still obscure, he became the martyr of this movement. Hundreds of thousands read his Autobiography. He was more influential in death than during his lifetime. Martin Luther King, though still respected, was being replaced now by new heroes: Huey Newton of the Black Panthers, for instance. The Panthers had guns; they said blacks should defend themselves. Malcolm X in late 1964 had spoken to black students from Mississippi visiting Harlem: Youll get freedom by letting your enemy know that youll do anything to get your freedom; then youll get it. Its the only way youll get it. When you get that kind of attitude, theyll label you as a crazy Negro, or theyll call you a crazy nigger—they dont say Negro. Or theyll call you an extremist or a subversive, or seditious, or a red or a radical. But when you stay radical long enough and get enough people to be like you, youll get your freedom. Congress responded to the riots of 1967 by passing the Civil Rights Act of 1968. Presumably it would make stronger the laws prohibiting violence against blacks; it increased the penalties against those depriving people of their civil rights. However, it said: The provisions of this section shall not apply to acts or omissions on the part of law enforcement officers, members of the National Guard ... or members of the Armed Forces of the United States, who are engaged in suppressing a riot or civil disturbance.... Furthermore, it added a section—agreed to by liberal members of Congress in order to get the whole bill passed-that provided up to five years in prison for anyone traveling interstate or using interstate facilities (including mail and telephone) to organize, promote, encourage, participate in, or carry on a riot. It defined a riot as an action by three or more people involving threats of violence- The first person prosecuted under the Civil Rights Act of 1968 was a young black leader of SNCC, H. Rap Brown, who had made a militant, angry speech in Maryland, just before a racial disturbance there. (Later the Act would be used against antiwar demonstrators in Chicago-the Chicago Eight.) Martin Luther King himself became more and more concerned about problems untouched by civil rights laws-problems coming out of poverty. In the spring of 1968, he began speaking out, against the advice of some Negro leaders who feared losing friends in Washington, against the war in Vietnam. He connected war and poverty: ... its inevitable that weve got to bring out the question of the tragic mix-up in priorities. We are spending all of this money for death and destruction, and not nearly enough money for life and constructive development... when the guns of war become a national obsession, social needs inevitably suffer. King now became a chief target of the FBI, which tapped his private phone conversations, sent him fake letters, threatened him, blackmailed him, and even suggested once in an anonymous letter that he commit suicide. FBI internal memos discussed finding a black leader to replace King. As a Senate report on the FBI said in 1976, the FBI tried to destroy Dr. Martin Luther King. King was turning his attention to troublesome questions. He still insisted on nonviolence. Riots were self-defeating, he thought. But they did express a deep feeling that could not be ignored. And so, nonviolence, he said, must be militant, massive non-violence. He planned a Poor Peoples Encampment in Washington, this time not with the paternal approval of the President. And he went to Memphis, Tennessee, to support a strike of garbage workers in that city. There, standing on a balcony outside his hotel room, he was shot to death by an unseen marksman. The Poor Peoples Encampment went on, and then it was broken up by police action, just as the World War I veterans Bonus Army of 1932 was dispersed. The killing of King brought new urban outbreaks all over the country, in which thirty-nine people were killed, thirty-five of them black. Evidence was piling up that even with all of the civil rights laws now on the books, the courts would not protect blacks against violence and injustice: In the 1967 riots in Detroit, three black teen-agers were killed in the Algiers Motel. Three Detroit policemen and a black private guard were tried for this triple murder. The defense conceded, a UPI dispatch said, that the four men had shot two of the blacks. A jury exonerated them. In Jackson, Mississippi, in the spring of 1970, on the campus of Jackson State College, a Negro college, police laid down a 28-second barrage of gunfire, using shotguns, rifles, and a submachine gun. Four hundred bullets or pieces of buckshot struck the girls dormitory and two black students were killed. A local grand jury found the attack justified and U.S. District Court Judge Harold Cox (a Kennedy appointee) declared that students who engage in civil disorders must expect to he injured or killed. In Boston in April 1970, a policeman shot and killed an unarmed black man, a patient in a ward in the Boston City Hospital, firing five shots after the black man snapped a towel at him. The chief judge of the municipal court of Boston exonerated the policeman. In Augusta, Georgia, in May 1970, six Negroes were shot to death during looting and disorder in the city. The New York Times reported: A confidential police report indicates that at least five of the victims were killed by the police... An eyewitness to one of the deaths said he had watched a Negro policeman and his white partner fire nine shots into the back of a man suspected of looting. They did not fire warning shots or ask him to stop running, said Charles A. Reid, a 38-year-old businessman... In April 1970, a federal jury in Boston found a policeman had used excessive force against two black soldiers from Fort Devens, and one of them required twelve stitches in his scalp; the judge awarded the servicemen $3 in damages. These were normal cases, endlessly repeated in the history of the country, coming randomly but persistently out of a racism deep in the institutions, the mind of the country. But there was something else-a planned pattern of violence against militant black organizers, carried on by the police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. On December 4, 1969, a little before five in the morning, a squad of Chicago police, armed with a submachine gun and shotguns, raided an apartment where Black Panthers lived. They fired at least eighty-two and perhaps two hundred rounds into the apartment, killing twenty-one-year-old Black Panther leader Fred Hampton as he lay in his bed, and another Black Panther, Mark Clark. Years later, it was discovered in a court proceeding that the FBI had an informer among the Panthers, and that they had given the police a floor plan of the apartment, including a sketch of where Fred Hampton slept. Was the government turning to murder and terror because the concessions-the legislation, the speeches, the intonation of the civil rights hymn We Shall Overcome by President Lyndon Johnson-were not working? It was discovered later that the government in all the years of the civil rights movement, while making concessions through Congress, was acting through the FBI to harass and break up black militant groups. Between 1956 and 1971 the FBI concluded a massive Counterintelligence Program (known as COINTELPRO) that took 295 actions against black groups. Black militancy seemed stubbornly resistant to destruction. A secret FBI report to President Nixon in 1970 said a recent poll indicates that approximately 25% of the black population has a great respect for the Black Panther Party, including 43% of blacks under 21 years of age. Was there fear that blacks would turn their attention from the controllable field of voting to the more dangerous arena of wealth and poverty-of class conflict? In 1966, seventy poor black people in Greenville, Mississippi, occupied an unused air force barracks, until they were evicted by the military. A local woman, Mrs. Unita Blackwell, said: I feel that the federal government have proven that it dont care about poor people. Everything that we have asked for through these years had been handed down on paper. Its never been a reality. We the poor people of Mississippi is tired. Were tired of it so were going to build for ourselves, because we dont have a government that represents us. Out of the 1967 riots in Detroit came an organization devoted to organizing black workers for revolutionary change. This was the League of Revolutionary Black Workers, which lasted until 1971 and influenced thousands of black workers in Detroit during its period of activity. The new emphasis was more dangerous than civil rights, because it created the possibility of blacks and whites uniting on the issue of class exploitation. Back in November 1963, A. Philip Randolph had spoken to an AFL-CIO convention about the civil rights movement, and foreseen its direction: The Negros protest today is but the first rumbling of the under-class. As the Negro has taken to the streets, so will the unemployed of all races take to the streets. Attempts began to do with blacks what had been done historically with whites-to lure a small number into the system with economic enticements. There was talk of black capitalism. Leaders of the NAACP and CORF, were invited to the White House. James Farmer of CORF, a former Freedom Rider and militant, was given a job in President Nixons administration. Floyd McKissick of CORE received a $14 million government loan to build a housing development in North Carolina. Lyndon Johnson had given jobs to some blacks through the Office of Economic Opportunity; Nixon set up an Office of Minority Business Enterprise. Chase Manhattan Bank and the Rockefeller family (controllers of Chase) took a special interest in developing black capitalism. The Rockefellers had always been financial patrons of the Urban League, and a strong influence in black education through their support of Negro colleges in the South. David Rockefeller tried to persuade his fellow capitalists that while helping black businessmen with money might not be fruitful in the short run, it was necessary to shape an environment in which the business can continue earning a profit four or five or ten years from now. With all of this, black business remained infinitesimally small. The largest black corporation (Motown Industries) had sales in 1974 of $45 million, while Exxon Corporation had sales of $42 billion. The total receipts of black-owned firms accounted for 0.3 percent of all business income. There was a small amount of change and a lot of publicity. There were more black faces in the newspapers and on television, creating an impression of change-and siphoning off into the mainstream a small but significant number of black leaders. Some new black voices spoke against this. Robert Allen (Black Awakening in Capitalist America) wrote: If the community as a whole is to benefit, then the community as a whole must be organized to manage collectively its internal economy and its business relations with white America. Black business firms must be treated and operated as social property, belonging to the general black community, not as the private property of individual or limited groups of individuals. This necessitates the dismantling of capitalist property relations in the black community and their replacement with a planned communal economy. A black woman, Patricia Robinson, in a pamphlet distributed in Boston in 1970 (Poor Black Woman), tied male supremacy to capitalism and said the black woman allies herself with the have- nots in the wider world and their revolutionary struggles. She said the poor black woman did not in the past question the social and economic system but now she must, and in fact, she has begun to question aggressive male domination and the class society which enforces it, capitalism. Another black woman, Margaret Wright, said she was not fighting for equality with men if it meant equality in the world of killing, the world of competition. I dont want to compete on no damned exploitative level. I dont want to exploit nobody.... I want the right to be black and me.... The system was working hard, by the late sixties and early seventies, to contain the frightening explosiveness of the black upsurge. Blacks were voting in large numbers in the South, and in the 1968 Democratic-Convention three blacks were admitted into the Mississippi delegation. By 1977, more than two thousand blacks held office in eleven southern states (in 1965 the number was seventy-two). There were two Congressmen, eleven state senators, ninety-five state representatives, 267 county commissioners, seventy-six mayors, 824 city council members, eighteen sheriffs or chiefs of police, 508 school board members. It was a dramatic advance. But blacks, with 20 percent of the Souths population, still held less than 3 percent of the elective offices. A New York Times reporter, analyzing the new situation in 1977, pointed out that even where blacks held important city offices: Whites almost always retain economic power. After Maynard Jackson, a black, became mayor of Atlanta, the white business establishment continued to exert its influence. Those blacks in the South who could afford to go to downtown restaurants and hotels were no longer barred because of their race. More blacks could go to colleges and universities, to law schools and medical schools. Northern cities were busing children back and forth in an attempt to create racially mixed schools, despite the racial segregation in housing. None of this, however, was halting what Frances Piven and Richard Cloward (Poor Peoples Movements) called the destruction of the black lower class—the unemployment, the deterioration of the ghetto, the rising crime, drug addiction, violence. In the summer of 1977, the Department of Labor reported that the rate of unemployment among black youths was 34.8 percent. A small new black middle class of blacks had been created, and it raised the overall statistics for black income-but there was a great disparity between the newly risen middle-class black and the poor left behind. Despite the new opportunities for a small number of blacks, the median black family income of 1977 was only about 60 percent that of whites; blacks were twice as likely to the of diabetes; seven times as likely to he victims of homicidal violence rising out of the poverty and despair of the ghetto. A New York Times report in early 1978 said: . .. the places that experienced urban riots in the 1960s have, with a few exceptions, changed little, and the conditions of poverty have spread in most cities. Statistics did not tell the whole story. Racism, always a national fact, not just a southern one, emerged in northern cities, as the federal government made concessions to poor blacks in a way that pitted them against poor whites for resources made scarce by the system. Blacks, freed from slavery to take their place under capitalism, had long been forced into conflict with whites for scarce jobs. Now, with desegregation in housing, blacks tried to move into neighborhoods where whites, themselves poor, crowded, troubled, could find in them a target for their anger. In the Boston Globe, November 1977: A Hispanic family of six fled their apartment in the Savin Hill section of Dorchester yesterday after a week of repeated stonings and window-smashings by a group of white youths, in what appears to have been racially motivated attacks, police said. In Boston, the busing of black children to white schools, and whites to black schools, set off a wave of white neighborhood violence. The use of busing to integrate schools—sponsored by the government and the courts in response to the black movement—was an ingenious concession to protest. It had the effect of pushing poor whites and poor blacks into competition for the miserable inadequate schools which the system provided for all the poor. Was the black population—hemmed into the ghetto, divided by the growth of a middle class, decimated by poverty, attacked by the government, driven into conflict with whites—under control? Surely, in the mid-seventies, there was no great black movement under way. Yet, a new black consciousness had been born and was still alive. Also, whites and blacks were crossing racial lines in the South to unite as a class against employers. In 1971, two thousand woodworkers in Mississippi, black and white, joined together to protest a new method of measuring wood that led to lower wages. In the textile mills of J. P. Stevens, where 44,000 workers were employed in eighty- five plants, mostly in the South, blacks and whites were working together in union activity. In Tifton, Georgia, and Milledgeville, Georgia, in 1977, blacks and whites served together on the union committees of their plants. Would a new black movement go beyond the limits of the civil rights actions of the sixties, beyond the spontaneous urban riots of the seventies, beyond separatism to a coalition of white and black in a historic new alliance? There was no way of knowing this in 1978. In 1978, 6 million black people were unemployed. As Langston Hughes said, what happens to a dream deferred? Does it dry up, or does it explode? If it did explode, as it had in the past, it would come with a certain inevitability- out of the conditions of black life in America-and yet, because no one knew when, it would come as a surprise."

Im just tryna shed a little light It can be hard It can be so hard But you gotta live right now You got everything to give right now Pre-Chorus: Logic Ive been on the low, I been taking my time I feel like Im out of my mind It feel like my life aint mine (Who can relate? Woo) Ive been on the low, I been taking my time I feel like Im out of my mind It feel like my life aint mine Chorus: Logic I finally wanna be alive, I finally wanna be alive I dont wanna die today, I dont wanna die I finally wanna be alive, I finally wanna be alive I dont wanna die, I dont wanna die Outro: Khalid Pain dont hurt the same, I know The lane I travel feels alone But Im moving til my legs give out And I see my tears melt in the snow But I dont wanna cry, I dont wanna cry anymore I wanna feel alive, I dont even wanna die anymore Oh, I dont wanna I dont wanna I dont even wanna die anymore"

The Fray,How to Save a Life,"Verse 1 Step one, you say, We need to talk He walks, you say, Sit down, its just a talk He smiles politely back at you You stare politely right on through Some sort of window to your right As he goes left and you stay right Between the lines of fear and blame You begin to wonder why you came Chorus Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend Somewhere along in the bitterness And I would have stayed up with you all night Had I known how to save a life Verse 2 Let him know that you know best Cause after all, you do know best Try to slip past his defense Without granting innocence Lay down a list of what is wrong The things youve told him all along Pray to God He hears you And pray to God He hears you, and Chorus Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend Somewhere along in the bitterness And I would have stayed up with you all night Had I known how to save a life Verse 3 As he begins to raise his voice You lower yours and grant him one last choice Drive until you lose the road Or break with the ones youve followed He will do one of two things He will admit to everything Or hell say hes just not the same And youll begin to wonder why you came Chorus Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend Somewhere along in the bitterness And I would have stayed up with you all night Had I known how to save a life Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend Somewhere along in the bitterness And I would have stayed up with you all night Had I known how to save a life Post-Chorus How to save a life How to save a life Chorus Where did I go wrong?
